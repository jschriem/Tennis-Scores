# Tennis Scores
Twitter bot that live tweets ATP & ITF tennis scores using python libraries **Tweepy** and **BeautifulSoup**.

I created this because I am a tennis fan and because I wanted to learn more about internet bots and web scraping. Specifically, I was curious about how apps like Google Assitant pulled information automatically from other websites and wanted to try it myself.  These resources [baseball_scraping](https://gist.github.com/CNuge/ca6f6b3b257cf59124c87e3c8e7c5d88#file-ttib-baseball_scraping-ipynb), [Beautiful Soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/), and [Tweepy](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/) were a big help during the process.
